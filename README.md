Libraries and Frameworks:

JavaScript
React 
BootStrap
HTML
CSS


Installation:

1. In the the bash command line terminal, run the command "create-react-app <'app-name'>". This will install the react library within app-name's directory and put the folder structure together that's needed for the build.

2. Within the directory is a 'src' folder where you will make another directory and call it 'components'. 'components' is where to put structural pieces of the app.

3. Components should contain js files for the html/css needed to build the app such as the header, navbar, footer, wrapper and whichever other pieces needed to build the frontend.

4. Within the root of the directory, create a json file and write an array of objects each containing the id, name, and image urls for the clickable elements of the game.


5. Each component to build the rendition of the app is exported to into the app js file that exists upon creation of the react app.
